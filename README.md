## Disclaimer
Model is not available yet as my GPU is not powerful enough to train on the full dataset. I will rent some time later. Check back in a while.

## Design
A relatively simple CNN. All images are resized to 256x256 before fed through the network. Details can be found in the files.

## Data Attribution
Data used is the classic [Food101 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ethz/food101). Big thanks to the contributors!
